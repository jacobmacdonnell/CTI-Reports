# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Intelligence Portfolio

Independent cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and OSINT investigations by **Jacob Macdonnell**.

This repository serves as a professional **portfolio of adversary analysis, campaign tracking, and strategic intelligence reporting**. All research is based on **legally obtained open-source intelligence (OSINT)** and produced for **educational and defensive cybersecurity purposes**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `reports/` | Full CTI investigations with deep infrastructure analysis, TTP mapping, attribution, and strategic assessment |
| `briefs/` | Short OSINT briefs summarizing threat campaigns, actor activity, or emerging trends |
| `templates/` | Reusable Markdown templates for new reports and briefs |
| `iocs/` *(optional)* | Consolidated indicators of compromise (IOCs) for reference or quick integration |

## 📊 About the Reports

Each report follows a structured analytic process aligned with industry standards (MITRE ATT&CK, Diamond Model, structured analytic tradecraft).  
They typically include:

- 🧠 **Background & context** – who, what, when, and why behind the activity  
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure analysis** – domains, IPs, SSL reuse, registration patterns, pivoting  
- 📊 **TTP mapping** – adversary techniques and procedures mapped to ATT&CK  
- 🧩 **Attribution assessment** – analytic judgments with confidence levels  
- 📈 **Strategic implications** – relevance to defenders, sectors, or geopolitical trends  
- 🔐 **Defensive recommendations** – detection, monitoring, and mitigation guidance  

Short OSINT briefs follow a lighter format optimized for quick consumption and situational awareness.
